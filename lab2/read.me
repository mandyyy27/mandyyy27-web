Title: Earthquake distribution and value and magnitude


This map is for anyone interested in maps and earthquakes, and as a resident of the West Coast growing up, I have always been highly interested in earthquakes and seismic zones. However, I am not sure of the exact frequency and magnitude of earthquakes.

In order to clear up the last data bias issue, I learned some python tricks to clean up the data from my computer science classmates, and although it was not proficient and took a large portion of my time, it was extremely helpful in organizing the data for this map.

The dataset is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/garrickhague/world-earthquake-data-from-1906-2022
